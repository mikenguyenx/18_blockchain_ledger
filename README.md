# PyChain Ledger

You’re a fintech engineer who’s working at one of the five largest banks in the world. You were recently promoted to act as the lead developer on their decentralized finance team. Your task is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.


## Technologies

Programming Languages: Python 3.7.13 

Libraries: 
- Pandas - a Python library that is used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. 
- Streamlit - an open-source Python library that is designed to create custom web applications for machine learning and data science projects. It allows you to turn your data scripts into interactive web applications with just a few lines of code, making it easier to share and visualize your results with others.

Operating System(s):  Any operating system that supports Python, including Windows & macOS.

## Installation Guide

To run this analysis, make sure you install the necessary dependencies:

1. Install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Clone the repository: git clone "https://github.com/mikenguyenx/18_blockchain_ledger.git" using git or download the ZIP file and extract it to a local directory.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory with the python file.
2. Open `pychain.py` in preferred integrated development environment.


## Instructions

The steps for this Challenge are divided into the following sections:

- Create a Record Data Class

- Modify the Existing Block Data Class to Store Record Data

- Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit Interface

- Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records
